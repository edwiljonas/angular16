               I used an array of available options to deliver the content to the front-end ie:
               <ul>
                  <li>$HTTP get to retrieve a json file and output the data on the front end.</li>
                  <li>Service/Factory controller to make data globally available throughout the project.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2>What I did for MongoDB</h2>
         <p>
            I seemed to be having some issues with MongoDB, however, like I said above: I will be able to get the required knowledge after some training with MongoDB and Node.js.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Downloaded and installed mongo.</li>
            <li>Created default data/db folder structure to house all mongo database files.
               <ul>
                  <li>Proceed to powershell command line to start mongo server (Worked perfectly)</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Setup the latest version of node.js</li>
